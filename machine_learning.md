# An old problem with an old solution
["Runge's phenomenon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge's_phenomenon) is an observation related to the interpolation of a function by polynomials using equidistant nodes. Today, the observation is somewhat trivial or, at least, mainstream, but it drew attention when it was first made and survives to this day under the name "Runge's phenomenon" because of the standards or rigour have not always been the same among physicists and applied mathematicians. And since Dieudonné has written about Runge's phenomenon, it's impossible to put it in better terms:
