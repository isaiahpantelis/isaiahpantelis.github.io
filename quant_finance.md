# QuantLib on a Mac
Installing and using QuantLib on a mac is timeless entertainment. Although I've done it several times in the past, both on mac os x and on windows machines, it always takes me a few hours of googling and troubleshooting, and it always leaves me with the same feeling that it was all avoidable frustration since the online instructions were clear. I don't know why this is the case because I have a natural proclivity for attention to detail, but always somethings falls between the cracks. So I decided to document the process for my own benefit in a way that highlights the little things that derail the process and which, in hindsight, are obvious.

- Get the library

  QuantLib can be downloaded from here: [QuantLib](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/releases)

  On a mac, you'd want the `tar` file.

- Follow the installation instructions: [Installation](https://www.quantlib.org/install/macosx.shtml)
